# Linked List

A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property.
Similar to array list that contains list of values of any type. But the difference is that the linked list do not have indices.

Linked list consists of nodes and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

Singly linked list points the next node (in one direction) whereas Doubly linked list points to the next and previous node (bi-directional).


# Comparisons with Arrays

### Lists
* Do  not have indexes!
* Connected via nodes with a next pointer
* Random access is  not allowed

### Arrays
* indexed in order!
* Insertion and deletion can be expensive
* can quickly be accessed at a specific index
